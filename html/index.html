 <h3> Color Pattern </h3>
 <p>Snowy Owls are white birds with varying amounts of black or brown markings on the body and wings.<br> On females this can be quite dense, giving the bird a salt-and-pepper look.<br> Males tend to be paler and become whiter as they age. <br>The eyes are yellow.</p>


  <h3> Behavior </h3>
 <p>Look for Snowy Owls sitting on or near the ground in wide-open areas. <br>They often perch on rises such as the crests of dunes, or on fenceposts, telephone poles, and hay bales. <br>When they fly they usually stay close to the ground.<br>ter as they age. The eyes are yellow.</p>
